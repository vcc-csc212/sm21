#### Intro to the course {#intro}
Data structures and algorithms is arguably **the most important course you'll take** in Computer Science. From [getting internships and job offers](https://github.com/cassidoo/getting-a-gig) to [preparing for advanced courses](https://www.synergisticit.com/how-data-structures-and-algorithms-are-important-for-computer-science-graduates/), understanding data structures and algorithms is what differentiates programmers and coders from computer scientists and engineers.

Generally speaking, the data structures and algorithms course is one of the toughest for CS majors (across universities, not just at URI). This course should put together your problem solving and programming skills and push you to think beyond short and disjointed code-- enabling you to think through and solve large-scale and real-world problems.

Because the topics we're going to cover are already challenging in it of themselves, it's important you come in as prepared as possible so you don't have to play catch up while learning new material.

Working on C++ programming, problem-solving skills, and dividing-and-conquering is **strongly recommended for all** students and **tons of resources** to practice and review are available on [the resources page](/resources).

#### Navigating ths site {#site}
This site will be used to house all non-confidential course information such as [class resources](/resources), [syllabus](/syllabus), and [assignments](/todo). Use the sidebar on the left (right if on mobile) to view the pages, scroll down for all **important links** (such as Zoom).
- We will **not be using** Brightspace 
- We will be using **Piazza** for announcements and Q&A
- We will be using **Zoom** for all lectures and hours meetings (find links below)
	- You must be **logged in to Zoom using your URI address to access any Zoom meeting**. 
	- Use **SSO** (single sign-on) and when asked for a domain, use **uri-edu**.
	- Trouble logging in? Watch [this 30 second video demo](https://youtu.be/XYM-nMXAiRY).

#### Exams and Final Project {#final}
There are no exams for this course. There is, however, an open-ended [final project](/final) due on July 31st. That means you'll need to concurrently work on assignments + your final project after the first half of the session.
