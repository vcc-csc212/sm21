##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and use the following questions to guide your note-taking:  
<br>



##### In Class
In today's class we'll be doing a brief review of the time complexity for the sorting algorithms above and the rest of the time will be for you to start working on Deep Dive 2.

#### Pre-Reading for Dynamic Arrays (Implementation), Thursday 2/11 {#thurs}

##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and use the following questions to guide your note-taking:  
<br>
✔️ How does a dynamic array work?  
✔️ What're the pros and cons of using dynamic vs static arrays?  

##### Read/Watch/Review
Before attending class, please complete the material below:
- Read the [Lab 3 Handout](/sm21/lab03)
	- If you'd like an additional written explainer on dynamic arrays, read [Dynamic Array Data Structure](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/cpp/dynamic-array)
- Watch [The Simple and Elegant Idea behind Efficient Dynamic Arrays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij7NQ-0mIVA) (8 min)
	- He refers to a "previous video" which is [What if you had to invent a dynamic array?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AllG-i_yto) (14 min)-- this "previous video" isn't required but it's strongly recommended if you're confused by the starting point in the assigned video.
- Watch [Dynamic array and Static array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9mGE6-svxg) (12 min)
	- The code example is in JavaScript but the description applies to C++ as well.

##### In Class
In today's class we'll be continuing to work on our lab's dynamic array implementation.
