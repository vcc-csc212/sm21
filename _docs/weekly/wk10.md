#### Pre-Reading for BST Analysis, Tuesday 3/30 {#tues}

##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and use the following questions to guide your note-taking:  
<br>
✔️ What is the worst time complexity of inserting into a BST?  
✔️ What is the worst time complexity of deleting from a BST?  
✔️ What is the worst time complexity of searching a BST?  

##### Read/Watch/Review
Before attending class, please complete the material below:
- Read [BST Analysis](/files/bst-analysis.pdf)
	- Note that the worst-case given assumes a balanced tree, ideally want to define in terms of height rather than nodes (since height will give us a more accurate answer)
- Watch [Time Complexities of Binary Search Trees Operations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEoyeoHmqlk) (10 min)

##### In Class
In today's class we'll be reviewing and applying BST Analysis concepts, as well as reviewing [Final Project](/final) info.
