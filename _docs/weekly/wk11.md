#### Pre-Reading for Balanced Trees, Tuesday 4/6 {#tues}

##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and use the following questions to guide your note-taking:  
<br>
✔️ What are the advantages of self-balancing trees?  
✔️ What are types of self-balancing trees?  
✔️ What are rotations and how do they help create balanced trees?  
✔️ How do self-balancing trees perform insertions and deletions?

- Read [Different Self Balancing Binary Trees](https://iq.opengenus.org/different-self-balancing-binary-trees/)
- Watch [Red Black Tree 1 The Rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMExd4DthdA) (8 min)
- Watch [AVL 1 Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9sHvAnLN_w) (11 min)
- Explore this [AVL Tree visualizer](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html)
- Explore this [Red-Black Tree visualizer](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RedBlack.html)
- Watch [Trees 9 Introduction to rotations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0Y3kDuyUCU) (8 min)
- Watch [Trees 10 Rotations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NczBLeco6XA) (8 min)
- Watch [Trees 11 Coding Rotations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-nmgO8ALjM) (12 min)
