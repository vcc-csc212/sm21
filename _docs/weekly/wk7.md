#### Pre-Reading for Analyzing Recursive Algos, Tuesday {#tues}

##### Essential Questions

<br>
✔️ What is a recurrence relation and why is it useful?  
✔️ How do we derive a recurrence relation from code?  
✔️ How do we solve a recurrence relation to get the time complexity of a function?  

##### Read/Watch/Review

> **Notes:** 
- A lot of the pre-readings will mention **induction**. If you're unfamiliar with induction, please read [this introduction](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/mathematical-induction.html) before continuing.
- The **first reading below is a textbook chapter**. You may choose to **read the textbook chapter OR the three articles** beneath it. 
   - They all give relatively the same information, with the textbook going more in-depth and having better-explained examples.
- Don't be overwhelmed by the proofs-- you won't be doing formal proofs in this class, but you should understand how to confirm with yourself that your answers are correct for when we do practice problems.

Before attending class, please complete the material below:
- Read [Chapter 10: Recurrences](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/readings/MIT6_042JF10_chap10.pdf)
   - You can ignore sections 10.4.3-10.4.5
- Read [Recurrence Relation](https://algorithmtutor.com/Analysis-of-Algorithm/Recurrence-Relation/)
- Read [Solving Recurrence Relations (Part I)](https://algorithmtutor.com/Analysis-of-Algorithm/Solving-Recurrence-Relations-Part-I/)
- Read [Solving Recurrence Relations (Part III)](https://algorithmtutor.com/Analysis-of-Algorithm/Solving-Recurrence-Relations-Part-III/)
   - Purposely skipping Part II
- Watch [Recurrence Equations Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0iXqhqfDPo) (6 min)
- Watch [Recurrence Relations Discrete Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAaP4XaB8hM) (15 min)
