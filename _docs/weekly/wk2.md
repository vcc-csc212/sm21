#### Pre-Reading for Essential Math Overview {#tues}

> This is a hefty unit designed to review **several pre-algebra and pre-calculus topics**. If you’re comfortable with these concepts, you may skim material as you see fit. **If your math is rough around the edges**, please review the [Math Resources](/sm21/resources#math) available on the resource page **before completing these readings**.

##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and use the following questions to guide your note-taking:  
<br>
✔️ What are the rules and properties of **exponents**?  
✔️ What are the rules and properties of **logarithms**?  
✔️ What does **logarithmic** growth look like?  
✔️ What does **exponential** growth look like?  
✔️ When are **permutations** useful and how are they calculated?  
✔️ When are **combinations** useful and how are they calculated?  
✔️ When are **summations** useful and how are they calculated?  
✔️ When are **factorials** useful and how are they calculated?

##### Read/Watch/Review
Before attending class, please complete the material below. 
- For a one-stop shop of Exponents and Logarithms, read [Exponentials: Discrete, Real, and Imaginary](https://sites.google.com/site/butwhymath/algebra/eponentials-discrete-real-and-imaginary). Alternatively, read the two separate readings below:
	- Read [Rules of Exponents](https://www.chilimath.com/lessons/intermediate-algebra/rules-of-exponents/) 
	- Read [Logarithms Explained](https://www.chilimath.com/lessons/advanced-algebra/logarithms-explained/)
- Read [Rules or Laws of Logarithms](https://www.chilimath.com/lessons/advanced-algebra/logarithm-rules/)
- Read/Watch [Permutations and Combinations](https://www.mathplanet.com/education/algebra-2/discrete-mathematics-and-probability/permutations-and-combinations)
- Read [Using Summation Notation](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/ivytech-collegealgebra/chapter/using-summation-notation/)
- Read [Summation Notation](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/SummationNotation.aspx) (pay close attention to the **formulas**)
- Read/Watch [Simplifying Factorials: The Easy Way](https://medium.com/i-math/simplifying-factorials-the-easy-way-61c221c21b57)

#### Pre-Reading for Dynamic Arrays {#weds}

##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and **use the following questions to guide your note-taking**:  
<br>
✔️ How are dynamic arrays different from (static) arrays?  
✔️ How do dynamic arrays work?
