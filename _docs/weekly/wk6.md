#### Pre-Reading for Mergesort, Tuesday 3/1 {#tues}

##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and use the following questions to guide your note-taking:  
<br>
✔️ How does the mergesort algorithm work?  
✔️ What's the time complexity of mergesort algorithm?  

##### Read/Watch/Review
Before attending class, please complete the material below:
- Read [Merge Sort Algorithm](https://www.interviewbit.com/tutorial/merge-sort-algorithm/)
- Watch [Merge Sort, GeeksforGeeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSceec-wEyw) (2 min)
- Watch [Algorithms: Merge Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF2j-9iSf4Q) (10 min)
	- Note that the implementation is in Java but the only differences for C++ would be using a pointer to an int array since we can't pass arrays in C++, and manually copying the array.
- Read [Analysis of Merge Sort](https://www.educative.io/courses/visual-introduction-to-algorithms/mXZyR)
- Watch [Why Is Merge Sort O(n * log(n))?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alJswNJ4P3U) (37 min)

##### In Class
In today's class we'll be debugging broken implementations of mergesort.
