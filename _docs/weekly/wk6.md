#### Pre-Reading for Recursion Crash Course, Tuesday {#tues}

##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and use the following questions to guide your note-taking:  
<br>
✔️ What is recursion and how does it work?  
✔️ When and why should/would one use recursion over iteration?  

##### Read/Watch/Review
- Read [How Recursion Works — Explained with Flowcharts and a Video](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-recursion-works-explained-with-flowcharts-and-a-video-de61f40cb7f9/)
- Watch [What on Earth is Recursion? - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv9NEXX1VHc) (9 min)
- Read [Reading 10: Recursion](https://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa15/classes/10-recursion/#reading_10_recursion)
- Watch [What is recursion? Programming Tutorial](hhttps://youtu.be/MwfvXDfaZeI?t=20) (15 min)

#### Pre-Reading for Mergesort, Wednesday {#weds}

##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and use the following questions to guide your note-taking:  
<br>
✔️ How does the mergesort algorithm work?  
✔️ What's the time complexity of mergesort algorithm?  

##### Read/Watch/Review
Before attending class, please complete the material below:
- Read [Merge Sort Algorithm](https://www.interviewbit.com/tutorial/merge-sort-algorithm/)
- Watch [Merge Sort, GeeksforGeeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSceec-wEyw) (2 min)
- Watch [Algorithms: Merge Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF2j-9iSf4Q) (10 min)
	- Note that the implementation is in Java but the only differences for C++ would be using a pointer to an int array since we can't pass arrays in C++, and manually copying the array.
- Read [Analysis of Merge Sort](https://www.educative.io/courses/visual-introduction-to-algorithms/mXZyR)
- Watch [Why Is Merge Sort O(n * log(n))?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alJswNJ4P3U) (37 min)

##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and use the following questions to guide your note-taking:  
<br>
✔️ How does the quicksort algorithm work?  
✔️ What's the time complexity of quicksort algorithm?    

##### Read/Watch/Review
Before attending class, please complete the material below:
- Read [Quick Sort Algorithm](https://www.interviewbit.com/tutorial/quicksort-algorithm/)
- Watch [Quick Sort, GeeksforGeeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgBzjlCcFvc) (3 min)
- Watch [Algorithms: Quick Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLauY6PpjW4) (9 min)
