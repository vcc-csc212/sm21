#### Pre-Reading for Introduction to trees {#tues}

##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and **use the following questions to guide your note-taking**:  
<br>
✔️ What is a tree?  
✔️ What're the different ways to traverse a tree?  
✔️ What're the steps necessary to determine the height of a tree?  
✔️ What're the steps necessary to determine if a tree is full or complete?  

##### Read/Watch/Review
Before attending class, please complete the material below:
- Read [Lab 19 Handout](/sm21/lab19)
- Read [Evan's Tree Guide](https://bit.ly/trees-guide)
- Watch [Binary Tree Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHB0B1jFKQc) (20 min)
	- We focus on binary trees of all trees since you'll be seeing a special type of binary tree tomorrow (binary search trees!).

#### Pre-Reading for Binary Search Tree {#weds}

##### Essential Questions

##### Read/Watch/Review
Before attending class, please complete the material below:

#### Pre-Reading for BST Analysis {#thurs}

##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and use the following questions to guide your note-taking:  
<br>
✔️ What is the average and worst time complexity of inserting into a BST?  
✔️ What is the average and worst time complexity of deleting from a BST?  
✔️ What is the average and worst time complexity of searching a BST?  

##### Read/Watch/Review
Before attending class, please complete the material below:
- Read [BST Analysis](/sm21/files/bst-analysis.pdf)
	- Note that the worst-case given assumes a balanced tree; ideally want to define in terms of height rather than nodes (since height will give us a more accurate answer). Watch video below to understand time complexity in terms of height.
- Watch [Time Complexities of Binary Search Trees Operations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEoyeoHmqlk) (10 min)
