#### Motivation (Why are we doing this?) {#motivation}
This lab will help you ensure you’re set up to code in C++ for the class and will also allow you to gain experience with an autograder used often in industry during interviews.

#### Background Info {#bgi}
Coding challenges have become more and more common as a part of the interview process for software engineeering internships and jobs. These coding challenges, usually timed, make use of an automated tester to determine whether your code works as expected. Today we'll be setting you up with one of the many websites that offer this service. If you'd like to explore others, [check out the ones listed on the resource page](/sm21/resouces#challenges).

#### Your Task {#task}
1. Sign up on [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [complete any one C++ challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp). Take a screenshot showing you've successfully completed it.
2. Set up the IDE you'll be using for the class. Download and install it if necessary, and write a short program that prints out "Hello `name`" where `name` is your name. Tak a screenshot of your IDE and console showing the expected output.
3. Explore the debugger of your chosen IDE. We have some [tutorials available on the resource page](/sm21/resouces#debuggers)

> Common 212 editors:
- [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/) (online, github auth)
- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) (cross-platform)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (cross-platform)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) (Windows)
- [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (Mac)
- Can also go old school and use traditional text-editors + Command Line Debugging-- [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) is a great debugger!

#### Requirements {#reqs}
Your submission will be **tested and graded by an autograder**, for this reason it cannot be stressed enough that your program must **exactly** follow the assignment specifications:  

1. Document includes both screenshots, as specified above
2. Screenshot shows successful completion of HackerRank challenge
3. Screenshot shows successful compliation and execution of program on IDE of choice

#### Handing in {#submit}
Place both screenshots onto a single document and upload it to Gradescope.
