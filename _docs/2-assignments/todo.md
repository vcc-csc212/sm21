##### This Week (5/24-5/28)
[Readings for<br>Tuesday](/sm21/wk2#tues)
: These readings will help you understand the **necessary pre-requisite math for conducting analysis of algorithms**. This is a hefty unit designed to review **several pre-algebra and pre-calculus topics**. If youâ€™re comfortable with these concepts, you may skim material as you see fit. **If your math is rough around the edges**, please review the [Math Resources](/sm21/resources#math) available on the resource page **before completing these readings**.

Tuesday Lab
: This lab will introduce you to the concept of analyzing algorithms. 

[Readings for<br>Wednesday](/sm21/wk2#weds)
: These readings will help you better understand a data structure you have probably used already: **Dynamic Arrays**, known as vectors in C++, lists in Python, ArrayLists in Java, and Arrays in JavaScript.

Wednesday Lab
: This lab will help you solidify your understanding of dynamic arrays by having you implement your own dynamic array.

[Readings for<br>Thursday](/sm21/wk2#thurs)
: These readings will teach you about **basic sorting algorithms** such as bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort.

Thursday Lab
: This lab will help you solidify your understanding of the implementation and analysis of basic sorting algos.
