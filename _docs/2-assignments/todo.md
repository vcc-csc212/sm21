##### This Week (6/28-7/2)
[Readings for<br>Tuesday](/sm21/wk6#tues)
: These readings will teach you about **recursion**, a way of writing solutions to problems that can also be solved iteratively.

[Tuesday Lab](/sm21/lab15)
: This lab will help you solidify your understanding of recursion.

[Readings for<br>Wednesday](/sm21/wk6#weds)
: These readings will teach you about **mergesort**, a more efficient sorting algorithm than linear search.

[Wednesday Lab]
: This lab will help you solidify your understanding of mergesort and quicksort (Thursday's topic).

[Readings for<br>Thursday](/sm21/wk6#thurs)
: These readings will teach you about **quicksort**, a more efficient sorting algorithm than linear search.

[Thursday Lab]
: Continued lab from Wednesday. This lab will help you solidify your understanding of mergesort and quicksort.
