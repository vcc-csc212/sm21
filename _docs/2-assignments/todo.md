##### This Week (7/5-7/9)
[Readings for<br>Tuesday](/sm21/wk7#tues)
: These readings will teach you about **analyzing recursive functions**, a way to mathemtically determine the time complexity of recursive functions.

[Tuesday Lab]
: This lab will help you solidify your understanding of analyzing recursive functions using recurrence relations.

[Readings for<br>Wednesday](/sm21/wk7#weds)
: These readings will teach you about **recursive backtracking**, a way to solve problems with several paths.

[Wednesday Lab]
: This lab will help you solidify your understanding of mergesort and quicksort (Thursday's topic).

[Readings for<br>Thursday](/sm21/wk7#thurs)
: Cotinued from Wednesday. These readings will teach you about **recursive backtracking**, a way to solve problems with several paths.

[Thursday Lab]
: Continued lab from Wednesday. This lab will help you solidify your understanding of recursive backtracking.
